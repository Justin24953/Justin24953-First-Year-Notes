          Started learning Html and CSS as my first introduction to coding. I
          took a break from that to learn Javascript which at the time was more
          interesting to me.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          In an effort to increase my html and css skills I'm using this doc to
          record my progress.

        <p class="text">
          I have a couple things I have to complete for this blog today.
        </p>

        <ol class="text">
          <li>Learn how to create spaces between my paragraph lines.</li>
          <li>Learn how to use images in html.</li>
          <li>Learn the proper way to format your html code.</li>
          <li>Learn how to create a link to your study resources.</li>
          <li>Start studying CSS</li>

          <ol>
            <li>All you need you need is a (br) tag which is self closing.</li>
            <li>
              You just need to use the (img) tag. You also have to label the
              image in the alt section. This gives a description of the image.
            </li>
            <li>
              I need to make sure I make proper indentations. I also need to
              make sure my opening and closing tags are lined up. I install
              prettier+ in VsCode to help.
            </li>
            <li>
              Anchor tags (a) are used for links. They can also be labeled.
              <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp"
                >Example</a
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              I wanted to add an image today but it was way too big. I can
              probably reduce the size by studying some CSS.
            </li>
          </ol>

          Started learning more about CSS. I realized I used a lot of tags
          without classes. If I don't add them now I'll be making a big mess
          than that I'll have to clean up later.
        </p>
        <ol class="text">
          <li>
            Add Classes to my tags so it's easier to style my html in the
            future.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add Images of things you want to add to the Blog.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the font to something more interesting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bold all key terms. Also Color HTML keywords with Orange and CSS
            with Blue
          </li>

          Learning more about CSS and hit my first roadblock (Flexbox) Seem like
          a big core of CSS so I'll makre sure to include it in this project.
        </p>
        <ul class="text">
          <li>
            One of the main problems I had with flexbox was that it wasn't
            working...I came to realize that I needed to use the display
            flex..before anything else. Used it to center my Title.
