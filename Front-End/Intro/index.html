      >Started learning Html and CSS as my first introduction to coding. I took
      a break from that to learn Javascript which at the time was more
      interesting to me.

        In an effort to increase my html and css skills I'm using this doc to
        record my progress.

      I have a couple things I have to complete for this blog today.
    </p>

    <ol class="Text">
      <li>Learn how to create spaces between my paragraph lines.</li>
      <li>Learn how to use images in html.</li>
      <li>Learn the proper way to format your html code.</li>
      <li>Learn how to create a link to your study resources.</li>
      <li>Start studying CSS</li>

      <ol>
        <li>All you need you need is a (br) tag which is self closing.</li>
        <li>
          You just need to use the (img) tag. You also have to label the image
          in the alt section. This gives a description of the image.
        </li>
        <li>
          I need to make sure I make proper indentations. I also need to make
          sure my opening and closing tags are lined up. I install prettier+ in
          VsCode to help.
        </li>
        <li>
          Anchor tags (a) are used for links. They can also be labeled.
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">Example</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          I wanted to add an image today but it was way too big. I can probably
          reduce the size by studying some CSS.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="Date">March 3, 2023</h4>
    <p class="Text">
      Started learning more about CSS. I realized I used a lot of tags without
      classes. If I don't add them now I'll be making a big mess than that I'll
      have to clean up later.
    </p>
    <ol class="Text">
      <li>
        Add Classes to my tags so it's easier to style my html in the future.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Images of things you want to add to the Blog.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the font to something more interesting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bold all key terms. Also Color HTML keywords with Orange and CSS with
        Blue
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="Date">March 5, 2023</h4>
    <p class="Text">
      Learning more about CSS and hit my first roadblock (Flexbox) Seem like a
      big core of CSS so I'll makre sure to include it in this project.
    </p>
    <ul class="Text">
      <li>
        One of the main problems I had with flexbox was that it wasn't
        working...I came to realize that I needed to use the display
        flex..before anything else. Used it to center my Title.
      </li>

      Currently working on a CSS project. I'll record the key things I've
      learned as a List below.
    </p>

    <ul class="Text">
      <li>
        Use Adobe Color and choose a color palette for your work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use FontPair. It's a site that shows Two Fonts that go together.
