    <h1>Tech Blog</h1>
    <h3>By: A Beginner</h3>
    <h4>March 1 2023</h4>
    <p1
      >Started learning Html and CSS as my first introduction to coding. I took
      a break from that to learn Javascript which at the time was more
      interesting to me.

      <p2>
        In an effort to increase my html and css skills I'm using this doc to
        record my progress.

    <h4>March 2, 2023</h4>
    <p>I have a couple things I have to complete for this blog today.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Learn how to create spaces between my paragraph lines.</li>
      <li>Learn how to use images in html.</li>
      <li>Learn the proper way to format your html code.</li>
      <li>Learn how to create a link to your study resources.</li>
      <li>Start studying CSS</li>
      <img src="" alt="" />
      <ol>
        <li>All you need you need is a (br) tag which is self closing.</li>
        <li>
          You just need to use the (img) tag. You also have to label the image
          in the alt section. This gives a description of the image.
        </li>
        <li>
          I need to make sure I make proper indentations. I also need to make
          sure my opening and closing tags are lined up. I install prettier+ in
          VsCode to help.
        </li>
        <li>
          Anchor tags (a) are used for links. They can also be labeled.
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">Example</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          I wanted to add an image today but it was way too big. I can probably
          reduce the size by studying some CSS.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
