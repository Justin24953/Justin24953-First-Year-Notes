# Assumptions
- Unlimted Ram Space
- Simple operations take one unit of work (+,*,-,/,var declarations)
- Data access is 1 operation
- Loops and functions are not simple ops
# Static Arrays
* arr = [a,b,c] 0,1,2
## Properties
* Represents a list
* Contiguous
* Mutable
* Fixed Size
# Dynamic Arrays
da = [a,b,c] 0,1,2
## Properties
* Represents a list
* ontiguois 
* Mutable
* Not Fixed size
# Time Complexity    
 ## O(n) Big O Notation
 * O(n) - the algorithms take proportionally longer to complete as the input grows.
 # Array Methods
 * push - adds element at the end - O(1)
 * pop - remove last element - O(1)
 * unshift - 
 * Missing Some
 # Common Methods for Algorithms
 * push - access - sort
 * pop - slice/copy
