/* Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height. */

// Create a String that creates a (8 x 8) grid (variable). 
// Use newline chracters tp separate lines.
// At Each Postion of the grid there is either a space or a '#' character.

let grid = ` Hi Jon`
 
// function createGrid (column,row,symbol,space) 


//console.log(createGrid(8,`4`,`#`),` `)

for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
  console.log(grid += `/n Hi`);
